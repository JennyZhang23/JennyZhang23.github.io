( ˶ˆᗜˆ˵ ) Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in psychometrics at the University of Hong Kong, advised by Professors [Jinsong Chen](https://web.edu.hku.hk/faculty-academics/jinsong). I have an academic background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. My research interests blend behavioral research, statistics, and machine learning. Currently, I am focusing on exploring factor analysis through Bayesian regularization.

**I expect to graduate in 2026 and am actively seeking job or postdoctoral positions worldwide**. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to impactful projects.  If you are aware of potential opportunities or would like to discuss collaborations, please feel free to contact me.
