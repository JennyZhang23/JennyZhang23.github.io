( ˶ˆᗜˆ˵ ) Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in psychometrics at the University of Hong Kong. I have an academic background in mathematics, statistics and computer science. My research interests blend behavioral research, statistics, and machine learning. Currently, I am focused on exploring factor analysis through Bayesian regularization.
