This timer is meant to help me manage my time…

for links to several prominent examples.[^1] 

{% capture notice-text %} I had an enormous amount of support in this
process from both my institutions and my networks; in no way could I
have gotten a data science job as easily on my own. I talk more about
the help I received [in this post](/posts/2022/07/insufficient-data). {%

Let’s get straight to the numbers. Out of 142 jobs I applied to, I
received two job offers. That’s a 98.6% rejection rate.[^3] Visualizing
this (with apologies to [Andrew
Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2018/12/17/academic-job-market-visualized))
looks like so.

[^1]: People have criticized the term quit lit for focusing on the
    individual and [ignoring the systemic
    forces](https://www.wihe.com/article-details/74/quit-lit-is-about-labor-conditions)
    that contribute to many people’s decision to leave academia. I am
    very persuaded by this argument, but no one has yet coined a
    similarly catchy and succinct alternative.
