> Yifan Zhang & Jinsong Chen (2023, March). Improving recommender system with the partially confirmatory approach and psychological factors. Coordinated paper presented at the National Council on Measurement in Education, Virtual, Chicago, IL.

<p style="font-size: 12pt; width: 100%; text-align: left;">This paper investigates if we can improve recommender system with the partially confirmatory approach. The proposed
approach comparable to conventional machine learning methods for recommendation. When incorporating partial

learning process transparent.</p>
